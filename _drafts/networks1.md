title: Language as a Complex Network, Part 1 of 4

%%% what is the goal of this? to be perfectly clear to a CS layman

There is a [special pattern](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0106096.pdf) to how many real networks are constructed. You will find it in the networks of people interacting in the world; you will find it in the networks of metabolism that act within one person; you will find it in the neural network of brains, in citations, protein networks, collaborations in movies, ecology, sex, cell phones, the Internet, and the words in language. Many of these networks have many of the very same properties.

Power laws in degree distributions.
Densification power law.
Weight power law.
Snapshot power law.
Triangle participation power law.
Eigenvalue power law.
Principle eigenvalue power law.
Small and shrinking diameter.
Giant component.
Constant size secondary and tertiary connected components.
Community structure which is modular.
Bursty weight additions.

This requires a model which is fractal in structure. %%% what do they mean by that? explain the adjacency matrix, Kronecker graph
