Definitional questions of play and work
====

It's often heard that work _should_ be like play (http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/how-i-make-work-like-play), (http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/microsoft-exec-why-work-email-should-be-playing-halo-n267336), (http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html), (http://positivesharing.com/2013/02/top-5-reasons-we-should-play-more-at-work/). It's a beautiful goal to strive for. Usually, this statement is presented in an informal manner, because people don't associate formalism with fun.

As a programmer and dude who likes reading the early Wittgenstein for fun, of course, this is not the case for me. Or, rather, I saw a systematic unclarity in the sentiment borne of very bad conflicts of interest for the kinds of people who write these things. It might be possible for the sentiment to be laudable, but the people who express the sentiment have such large conflicts of interest that we shouldn't listen to them. That, too, is an often-expressed sentiment. %%%%%%%%% links

One possible solution to such a situation is to try to go back to definitions. What is play? There is a literature on this, so we should look to it. From S. Brown's _Play, How It Shapes The Brain, Opens The Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul_:

PROPERTIES OF PLAY
- Apparently purposeless (done for its own sake)
- Voluntary
- Inherent attraction
- Diminished consciousness of time
- Diminished consciousness of self
- Improvisational potential
- Continuation desire

By _apparently purposeless_, Brown means that play is not teleological in nature, and does not have practical value: Play is "done for its own sake". This is really not a definition that a mathematician would accept, but it does some of the job of a definition: that is, it is _fundamentally incompatible_ with the statement that work should have a meaning and a purpose beyond the work itself, unless you would like to torture the meaning of _meaning_ quite a bit.

When we hear that play is _voluntary_, this statement delves into the question of the freedom of the will - an eternal argument of the philosophers - but all would agree a _work_ that would be voluntary is incompatible with the hoary old verse,

_For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat._ (2 Thess 3:10)

The other parts of the definition seem more compatible with the envisionment we've seen above, so I'll leave it to you all to think about how they might actually be compatible or not.

And once we hit upon a little depth in the thought that people have had about _play_, it is a natural progression to _games_. There is a neat little literature about play and games, and if you want to progress the metaphor further there are good books out there, by Huizinga, Sutton-Smith and many others.

I'm actually quite ambivalent about the nature of the normative connection between play and work myself. But it's quite fun to play with these definitions, isn't it?
