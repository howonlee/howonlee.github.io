title: Primitive Work
---

It is often heard that work should [be more like a primitive method of working](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html). This is held to be a counter-normative goal, meaning that it goes against a current status of the working world but is itself a norm, it says that we should work in a certain way. I want to look at seeing the norm, and seeing if it is a coherent one.

There's a Rosseau noble-savage whiff to the goal as presented, especially with Graham. This is probably because it's been a fairly common observation that life in hunter-gatherer society is more fun and surprisingly easier (for the hunter-gatherers) than in settled society, T. Hobbes's non-empirical claims about nasty brutish shortness notwithstanding. For example, B. Franklin in a letter to P. Collinson (from [_The Papers of Benjamin Franklin_](http://franklinpapers.org/franklin//)):

> When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and makes one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return. [But] when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho' ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tendencies to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.

Or RB. Lee in [_What Hunters Do for a Living, or, How to Make Out on Scarce Resources_](http://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/lee.pdf), who writes:

> A diet based on mongongo nuts _[a nut that the !Kung of the Kalahari gather]_ is in fact more reliable than one based on cultivated foods, and it is not surprising, therefore, that when a Bushman was asked why he hadn't taken to agriculture he replied: "Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?"

Some of this is like the [Paleo diet movement](http://magazine.good.is/articles/good-asks-the-experts-is-the-paleolithic-diet-really-better?utm_source=supr), in that it's really quite ahistorical, it's more influenced by a very modern image of what the prehistoric was like. What was the structure of work with primitive people like?

Well, I'm no anthropologist, but I get journal access, so I can read anthropologists. It seems that the place to start with regards to this top is a remarkable and important essay from M. Sahlins called [_The Original Affluent Society_](http://www.primitivism.com/original-affluent.htm). There's also some data in the book in which the essay was also printed, [Stone Age Economics](http://www.amazon.com/Stone-Age-Economics-Marshall-Sahlins/dp/0202010996) (if you know what you're doing, you can also get the book free).

Sahlins has long been a critic of _homo economicus_, but as he's an anthropologist few of the economists have ever really listened to him (unlike, say, D. Kahneman).

Now, you can't just look at one source with regards to these things, so we should look at D. Kaplan's _The Darker Side of the "Original Affluent Society"_
