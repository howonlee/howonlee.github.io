title: Working Time
---

An implicit claim of the current way of things is that there is:
- A normal amount of time to work.
- The normal amount of time of work is to work 40 hours a day, 9 to 5, Monday to Friday.

Obviously, 2. depends logically upon 1. The lived critique that startup people and other differently-working people make upon this structure of time is that 1. is not the case.

stone age economics: the comparatively homogenous stone age man works 25 hour weeks, organized roughly 7 hours every other day. they treat their stuff like shit. they kind of mock settled people (I suspect this is a selection bias, as those who didn't mock settled people probably eventually became settled people) and are possessed of a grand disinclination to work all that much. the summary is that their economics is not really limited on scarcity but on the threat of diminishing returns.

economics has always concerned itself with the threat of scarcity, but diminishing returns is also a phenomenon of human attitudes towards things and money which is fundamentally not a scarcity phenomenon.

one important place where diminishing returns predominates is in time.
