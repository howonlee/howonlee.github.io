title: Native American Feature Engineering
---

Often, it is noted that the key to having a good statistical model is in choosing the right features. Is there a general science of feature engineering? No, although the unsupervised feature learning and deep learning people are working pretty hard on it. But a sociology text posed an interesting statement as to what that sort of practical knowledge which works best as a model of the world is. From [_Seeing like a State_](http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153):

>When the first European settlers in North America were wondering when and how to plant New World cultivars, such as maize, they turned to the local knowledge of their Native American neighbors for help. They were told by Squanto, according to one legend (Chief Massasoit, according to another), to plant corn when the oak leaves were the size of a squirrel's ear. \n
Embedded in this advice, however folkloric its ring today, is a finely observed knowledge of the succession of natural events in the New England spring. For Native Americans it was this _orderly_ succession of, say, the skunk cabbage appearing, the willows beginning to leaf, the red-wing blackbird returning, and the first hatch of the mayfly that provided a readily observable calendar of spring. While the timing of these events might be earlier or later in a given year and while the pace of their succession might be more drawn out or accelerated, the _sequence_ of the events was almost never violated. As a rule of thumb, it was a nearly fooldproof formula for avoiding a frost.
