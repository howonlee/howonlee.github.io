title: Freedom of the Will
---

It is obvious that the calculus has fundamental things to say about Zeno's paradox. The non-philosopher would say that there is a permanent solution to Zeno's paradox hidden in the intuition which we have on the calculus. (The philosopher looks too carefully, and finds problems. Perhaps one day we will all be satisfied).

In this domain the singularity of susceptibility in the Ising model is to the question of the freedom of the will as the calculus is to Zeno's paradox. This is a more important analogy than the usual thoughts about quantum mechanics, because everything is classical, and a quick route towards the modelling of the mind is implied - the Hopfield net, and everything that came from that idea.
