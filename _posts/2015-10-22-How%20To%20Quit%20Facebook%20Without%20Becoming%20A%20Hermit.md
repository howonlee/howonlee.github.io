This is a pretty blatant plug for this site I made, Diogenes. But I think your time gets sucked up enough already by Facebook that I hope you will read this anyways, and I'm not going to make any money off of Diogenes anytime soon, so I hope that you understand that this is the ultimate expression of a thought I had about Facebook, why I should quit it and how I quit it for more than two years.

I think that nearly all social media is insidious in that way, in that it provides a more direct route towards social disconnection and alienation than, say, alcohol does.
