title: Reflections On Quitting Facebook
---

In 2012, I successfully drastically curtailed my use of facebook to once every two weeks or one week. The time I spent on facebook reduced bit by bit until I successfully quit facebook and stopped using it in 2013. I stopped using Reddit and any other social media or social networks in late 2015, down to quitting the forums I used to visit. If you're reading this, I've been able to stay off for a fair while.

I'd like to talk about the mechanism of how I did it.

Of course, this consists in extinguishing a habit. The essential thing about what a habit is, I think, is that it be autotelic. That is, it has to have its own logic about it. If you are motivated to do it, it is in the process of changing: it cannot be a habit. Spending time in facebook is not motivated by rational considered thought about the benefits or detriments of doing same. It is simply done, and when you are asked _why_, you sort of perseverate a reason. "To keep track of my friends", you say. And this might be one factor of causation there, because if all of your friends moved _off_ of facebook, you might get off also. But it's not a reasoned thought that goes on when you get on it.

Just because it's autotelic in that way doesn't mean you can't understand it and investigate the causation of things. The growth of algae is really autotelic: it grows when it grows, but it's often much less helpful to think about the endogenous causes of the differential growth of algae than the exogenous causes. Algae grow on nearly every pond, but only some ponds overgrow radically to produce anoxic conditions. Why is that the case? Only some places have the conditions that allow algae to grow out of conditions. To make clear the analogy, only some states of mind have the conditions that allow social media usage to grow out of control.

When you have many possible causes for a phenomenon, the typical thing to do is to list them all and attempt to balance them by listing a few arguments about the respective weighing of them. The implicit claim is that a cause has a normal effect on the phenomenon, and that a bell curve obtains for how much certain causes affect the phenomenon you're talking about. I reject this entirely.

When you have coherent causes that can be talked about in language, I think most often, they have radically unequal effects on the phenomena. Nutrition, quality of life, standard of living, medical care, genetics, mother's gestation time, fetal nutrition factors and endocrine factors affect someone's height, but this does not preclude you from knowing 95% of the variance in someone's height from two pieces of knowledge:

1. How tall were their parents?
2. How many grams of protein do they get?

I think something similar obtains for the causation of a social media addiction. I think if you know two facts about someone, you will be able to know much of the relevant information about how trapped they are (or can be).

1. How afraid are they of rejection?
2. How alone do they feel?

Pennebaker's procedure on writing emotions down.
My own emotional backing on it, on rejection and the maintenance of something.

Really, it's in the nature of reading that you won't learn a goddamned thing from this writing.
The nature of teaching. You will be able to come to the same conclusions as I have when you can write this essay for yourself, in other words. After that, you will be able to throw away the ladder that you climbed on.

Cybernetic and epanastatic influences. This is the difference between negative and positive feedback systems.

I would be a hypocrite and a liar if I kept track of any of this stuff on social media, so I won't. If you'd like, you can email me at hlee . howon at gmail.com.
