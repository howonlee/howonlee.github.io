title: I quit Facebook for 2 years and talked to my friends via cronjob

%%%% reread the sherry turkle book?

This is a pretty blatant plug for this site I made, Diogenes. But I think your time gets sucked up enough already by Facebook that I hope you will read this anyways, and I'm not going to make any money off of Diogenes anytime soon, so I hope that you understand that this is the ultimate expression of a thought I had about Facebook, why I should quit it and how I quit it for more than two years.

Why facebook addicts you
---

There is no such thing as an addiction without a concomitant emptiness in your life. Millions of people in America play dice and cards and gamble in America without it being too much of a problem, but of those people a few, torn by loneliness and social disconnection and alienation from a coherent social life, lose their lives in it. %% cite B. alexander

I think that nearly all social media is insidious in that way, in that it provides a more direct route towards social disconnection and alienation than, say, alcohol does.

How?

It inspires you to replace normal interaction with social media. I don't expect you to be able to see such a thing when you're in the middle of it, so I will tell you instead about the mechanism by which it happens.

%%%% FOMO: a narrative

%%%% maybe do it by elision

%%%% make a profile of the identity that fb gives you?

%%%% recognize the ecological aspect of it, basically... the trust in the world?

%%%% p. writing?
