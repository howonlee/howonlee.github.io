Percolation graph matching is definitely one of the more interesting algorithms I've seen. It's a way to approximate in linear time the graph matching problem. It gives a speedup to any such problem if (and only if) you have an initial "seed" matching that's pretty tiny in comparison to the final answer. It's a O(2^n) to O(n) sort of speedup, so actually pretty profound.

Suppose you have a big graph, called $G$. It has a set of vertices and a set of edges, denoted $V$ and $E$, respectively.
