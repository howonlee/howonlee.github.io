Feudalism, at its core, consisted of three parts: an attitude towards the means of production, an attitude towards religion, and an attitude towards violence and power. It's the last which we talk of today.

The modern Westphalian state has monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in a territory, but the signature feature of vassalism, the violence-military-power portion of feudalism, is that there is no such monopoly: each nobleman swears fealty of his armies to whomever (and often more than one liege - feudalism was a DAG, not a tree) but each significant noble in turn had the right to have weapons, armor, small or large armies and castles and to enact laws and put peasants to death and so on.

Because each party is armed, every relation between liege-lord and significant vassal was significantly negotiated and idiosyncratic and often fraught. In addition, because of the negotiated and idiosyncratic nature of each relation, each relation was deeply personalistic, and wars could really break out based on the whims of military noblemen.

Wars do not break out for personalistic reasons anymore with the modern Westphalian state - that's a causus belli for drunken fistfights, not for artillery and drone strikes. Even deeply stupid wars such as the current Ukranian-Russian war or the second Iraq-American war had considered casus belli which were represented to be non-arbitrary. But when we see modern Westphalian states fail, something like that dense oligarchy of violence often quickly results.

One facet of modern life, however, has a straightforward dense oligarchy of violence: the large corporation. Of course the violence is milder than getting chopped to death, but there is still some violence: people get dismissed and other disciplinary action and so on. But it is in the nature of this soft violence that there is no monopoly on its legitimate form.

In a 100,000 person company, there must be some oligarchy of capability to enact dismissal, to commit to disciplinary action. It can't be a real monopoly because it's just too much for one person and it's not spread evenly. Just because there's a formal hierarchy doesn't mean it has any reality, just as ostensible feudal hierarchies were often flimsy negotiated things.

Given that, by the mere lack of a monopoly on violence, all the consequence of vassalism ensue.

Chief of those consequences of vassalism that ensue is the personalism and idiosyncrasy of every last thing. When you enter a modern vast company, there is no _there_ there as to what you can take away from the experience as to any other part of the company. No uniformity of relation can ever be assumed for anything, simply because of the lack of a monopoly on violence.

Suppose you're a peasant in rural France in 1180 AD. You couldn't say anything coherent about your life based only on this information: even the notion of a coherent France was created centuries later. What would be coherent information would be that you are some smallholder in an assiduously small area, paying fealty to the Baron Such-and-Such, who demands some precise (the exact volume engraved in stone) amount of grain in taxes (and the Baron one day wishes to better his finances and starts whittling out the bowl carved in stone more...) and corvee labor as negotiated by your ancestors hundreds of years ago, with soil of exactly this fertility and which needs to be fallowed this exact amount and... and... and...

And, of course, do not forget that they've never heard of and probably never care about the king who the history books remember about the period, except in some coins or something.

This is the grand level of lack of abstraction of a feudal situation. Expect it of any mention of a megacorp with such a lack of the monopoly on violence. And when you hear "Oh, FooCorp does this or that", of something that deals with people, dismiss it entirely and just know that some merry band of people at FooCorp do it. And the CEO of FooCorp certainly doesn't have anything to do with your life as a FooCorp employee, except on some meaningless trinkets or waves which wreck you after many layers of indirection.
