Consider the expectation value, or first moment,

Linearity, Markov inequality, Chebyshev inequality, as usual:

But consider just taking all this stuff and going off to multiplication-land. Denote what we're doing the multiplicative (first) moment,

and we get some different properties. If you think of expected value as normalized arithmetic mean, this is normalized harmonic mean.

Something not entirely unlike Markov's inequality, given positive values of RV:

###### ok, first attack is just take log of the whole shebang and deal with it, which seems lame and gives something maybe too markov-inequality-ey
