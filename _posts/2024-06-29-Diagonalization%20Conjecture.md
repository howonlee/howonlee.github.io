title: Diagonalization-Power-Law Conjecture
---

Conjecture: We should be able to unify the dozen (two dozen, three dozen, go read [MEJ Newman's review](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0412004)) putative universal causes of power law phenomena by proving that a _Cantor-style diagonalization_ process can come up with them at the _probabilistic-logical_ level.
