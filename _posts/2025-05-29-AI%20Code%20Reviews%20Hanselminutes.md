title: AI Code Reviews (Hanselminutes)
---

_What if AI could not only speed up your code reviews—but actually make them fairer? In this episode of Hanselminutes, Scott Hanselman chats with Howon Lee, Senior Software Engineer at CodeRabbit, about how AI is changing the game when it comes to code reviews. They dig into the unspoken dynamics that can pop up in traditional reviews—like how seniority or team politics sometimes matter more than the code itself. Howon shares why AI can be a helpful, unbiased voice that gives everyone clear, consistent feedback, no matter their experience level. They also talk about how tools like CodeRabbit are working to make software development more inclusive and collaborative._
