Howon Lee is a student. [He writes code.](http://github.com/howonlee)

The name of the blog is due to two fascinations which have endured for years upon years. There was a [poem by D. Thomas](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fern-hill) which strikes to the shadow of what being itself is, and a [picture by M. Barnsley](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BarnsleysFern.html) which is one of the keys to the understanding of society.
