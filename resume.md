Work Experience

***Research Assistant***
**Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab**
**Current, from September 2012**
Aided the development of research projects by Ph.D students in the lab under the supervision of Professor Jeremy Bailenson. Specifically, aided in the development of virtual worlds that would be the settings of experiments and demos, created a custom playback system for Kinect recordings of human movements, assisted with various machine learning tasks, and helped develop a Unity application which would allow Android phones to be used as head-mounted devices for virtual reality.


***Data Science Intern***
**The Backplane, Inc.**
Created the predictive analytics system incorporating a Mahout and MapReduce system, which predicted the user retention rate of a website with 20,000 active users, and created a custom AB split testing solution for their AB testing needs. Presented the architecture of this system to coworkers.


***Research Assistant***
**Stanford Parallel Distributed Processing Lab**
**June-September 2012**
Aided the postdoctorate researcher Juan Gao under the direction of the PI Professor Jay McClelland with human-computer interaction research. Specifically, we investigated the differential reaction times that people have on mobile phones and PC's, making an Android app that 100 subjects used as part of this research.

Projects

***Extremal Optimization for Boltzmann Machines***
You know how they tell you in school that fully connected Boltzmann machines are not suitable for use in real applications because the simulated annealing takes too long? I tested what happens if you don't use simulated annealing, and found about one order of magnitude speedup over simulated annealing.
**For Psychology 209, Neural Nets**

***Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Text Generation***
Used a physics-based cellular automaton to generate Markov chain-style text. Nobody had done this before.
**Not for school.**

***Babelfish***
Made, with a team, a javascript mashup of Google Translate to let you speak to the computer and have it speak back translated text, in whatever language to whatever language.
**2nd place at the 2013 Stanford Winter ACM Hackathon.**

***Alpha-Phi Algorithm***
Novel algorithm and implementation in MapReduce developed in a team for the class, **Project in Mining Massive Data Sets**, under Jeffrey Ullman. 3% better AUC than the published Cascades algorithm for predicting the size of a Twitter cascade.
